	<h1>Company: <span>Just Solutions</span><br/>Role: <span>Web&nbsp;Developer & Graphics Designer</span></h1>
	<p> Just Solutions is a start-up online store that deals with sale of products on Amazon. Just Solution’s products rank among the top five on Amazon.

I worked with a team of editors and marketers to build a complete and all-round an e-Commerce website. However, I was also seen playing a huge role in other aspects of the compnay. For example, when launching new products I would take the position of the graphics designer as I was able to create illustrations in the Adobe Suite and 3D visuals in CAD.</p>
