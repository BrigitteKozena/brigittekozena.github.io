      This week I have learnt a lot about the ins and out of github and how it makes collaborating easy! 

      Githubs version control allows you to record the changes you are making to a file. This means when you and your group are working on the same file at the same time you are able to upload your work without overwriting each others progress. 

      The software allows you to make notes of the changes you made to each upload which helps when working in teams or when going back to the code after a long time. 
      Github is a great place to store your code as it is used by many coders around the world.  It is also a trustworthy, reliable site.
