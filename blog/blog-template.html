How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
We both ende dup designing our own wireframes as we had different ideas for our blog page. It was nice getting/giving feedback on each others work and seeingif thre are other elements that we could incorporate. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, this gives an idea of the space we are designating to each section and keeps and organized formatt to the work. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We learnt about nav for the navagation as well as aside for potential things on the side.
