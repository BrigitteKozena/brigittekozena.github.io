		<h1> Arrays & Hashes </h1>
		
<p>Arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Array indexing starts at 0 negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the arrayâ€”that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on. Look here for more.

A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted.

Hashes have a default value that is returned when accessing keys that do not exist in the hash. By default, that value is nil. Look here for more.</p>
