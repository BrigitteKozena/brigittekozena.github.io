			<h1>Enumerable</h1>
			<p>
			The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.</p>

			<h1>Enumerable Cycle</h1>
			<p>
			Calls block for each element of enum repeatedly n times or forever if none or nil is given. If a non-positive number is given or the collection is empty, does nothing. Returns nil if the loop has finished without getting interrupted.

			#cycle saves elements in an internal array so changes to enum after the first pass have no effect.

			If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.</p>
